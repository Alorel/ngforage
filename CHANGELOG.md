* Update README.md for 4.0 ([e8ea7fb](https://github.com/Alorel/ngforage/commit/e8ea7fb))


### Maintenance

* **package:** Remove jsdelivr link ([ffa36b4](https://github.com/Alorel/ngforage/commit/ffa36b4))
* Drop session storage from library ([6aa76e3](https://github.com/Alorel/ngforage/commit/6aa76e3))


### Performance Improvements

* **demo:** Removed unnecessary decorators, heavier use of prototypes, observables and subjects now handled with NgxDecorate ([89ae9b0](https://github.com/Alorel/ngforage/commit/89ae9b0))


### Refactoring

* Initial migration to ng7, angular-cli>=6.2.0 and yarn ([fa3dd35](https://github.com/Alorel/ngforage/commit/fa3dd35))
* Rename library files in Angular format ([4b8cc7c](https://github.com/Alorel/ngforage/commit/4b8cc7c))
* **internal:** use @Proto decorator where appropriate, resolve strict mode tsc errors ([517f985](https://github.com/Alorel/ngforage/commit/517f985))
* Replaced driver static props on NgForageConfig with Driver enum. ([550f758](https://github.com/Alorel/ngforage/commit/550f758))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* sessionStorage is no longer supported by default. If you need sessionStorage support you can use the [localforage-driver-session-storage](https://npmjs.com/package/localforage-driver-session-storage) package.
* Driver names are now accessed via `import {Driver} from 'ngforage'`. See [migration notes](https://github.com/Alorel/ngforage/blob/4.0.0/MIGRATING.md).
* relative import paths are no longer officially supported. Everything must now be imported from the ngforage package.
